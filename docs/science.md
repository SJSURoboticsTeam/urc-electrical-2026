## Summary

The science board is used to control the different aspects of the rover used for science, including hall effect sensors, color sensors, lasors, servos, and the fan. I^2 C communication is used. USB data communications is used for controls testing.

## Design Notes

- Resistors for the LEDs adjusted
- buck removed; on a separate board
- H20 pumps removed; on separate board
- lasors added
